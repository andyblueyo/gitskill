# Git Skill

## Project Description
GitHub is a great way to see work someone has previously done. Public repositories allow others to explore projects as well as view how the code is written. It's a fantastic way to showcase work, especially to future employers. Our research project is focused on defining the value of GitHub, especially for students, and better understanding the implications of what being active on GitHub can mean. 

Our project will be further defined by our hypothesis and its supporting questions. Our hypotheses is listed below. 
* Based on data from GitHub, are we able to predict the skills a user will need to display on their GitHub in order to work for certain companies?
* Is there a relationship between skills a user displayed on their GitHub and the company they are currently working for? I.e. do a lot of their projects have React and are they currently at Facebook? 
* Are we able to create models that showcase skills certain companies value in their applicants?

For this project we will be working with data from GitHub’s API. It will allow us to access data about a user's repositories, including languages used, lines of code, and commit history. We will collect this data using our own accounts as well as the user’s account (via OAuth).

Our target users for this project are students who are similar to us: seeking developer roles, students, and using GitHub. In the future, we also believe that recruiters could be interested in this project, as a tool to find candidates who have proven their skills. 

From this project, we are hoping our audience of student developers will be able to better understand what can make them a competitive applicant for jobs in tech companies. 
* What skills will I need to work at X company?
* What companies are looking for applicants with Y skills?
* What skills is X company looking for?
* What repositories can I look at to improve my skills in X?
