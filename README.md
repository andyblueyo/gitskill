## Project Description
GitHub is a great way to see work that has been shared in the community. Public repositories allow others to explore projects as well as view how the code is written. A popular metric of popularity for a project on GitHub are stars, where users can show support by marking repositories with a star. A star on a repository allow users to find this repository easier later, allows GitHub to recommend more similar repositories, and most importantly, increases the popularity of this repository for GitHubâ€™s Explore page, where repositories are featured to the developer community.

In this project, our team focused on exploring the possibilities of predicting number of stars. The defining questions and hypothesis are listed below.

* Based on data from GitHub, are we able to predict the number of stars a repo from an organization or user can have?
* Is there a relationship between features on GitHub and number of stars?
